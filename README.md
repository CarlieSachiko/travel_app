#Travlr App
####Created By Carlie Clippinger

###About
I created this app as a tool to accomplish your bucket list! Each user has a bucket list where they can save places they want to go, as well as things to do in each of those places. Users also have the ability to create trips. These trips have an itinerary for easy and organized planning. You are also able to invite other users to your trips.

Happy travelling!

###Unsolved Problems
* Required password length
* Rotating background images on my home page
* Days don't appear in chronological order

--------
###Next Steps
Here is a list of things I would like to do in the future:
* Think of a name for the app
* Add comments to the trips so users can collaborate
* Enable users to message each other
* Confirm email by sending confirmation to user's email
* Buttons for different show options on trips index page
* Ensure users can't add duplicate days to a trip
* Put days in correct order on timeline
* Users will receive notifications when they are invited to a trip or when a user has made any changes
* Create a more feed-like home page, where users can follow each other, create posts, like posts, and so on...
* Make it more responsive
* Clean up the forms
* White text can be difficult to read in some areas
* Make form text white on landing page so it is easier to read
* Add API so users can search for their locations then add them to their Bucket List or Trip
    * Autofill when adding a city to the bucket list
    * Suggestions on things to do, sights, etc. in those cities
    * A user is unable to add a city that doesn't exist
* And much more!
