###Next Steps
Here is a list of things I would like to do in the future:
* Add comments to the trips so users can collaborate
* Enable users to message each other
* Users will receive notifications when they are invited to a trip or when a user has made any changes
* Create a more feed-like home page, where users can follow each other, create posts, like posts, and so on
* Make it more responsive
* Add API so users can search for their locations then add them to their Bucket List or Trip
    * Make the text in the images clickable
